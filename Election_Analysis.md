#Election Analysis
##Overview of Project
After helping Tom and Seth with their election audit, the election comittee asked
for more a deeper analysis so they could determie the results. They wanted more
insights into the voter turnout, the highest amount of votes for each candidate and
county, and the percentage of votes per candidate out of the total votes. This
analysis is meant to help the election committe review their audit easily and see
the true wier o the election based off popular vote.

##Election-Audit Summary
Now that this pytho script is done, it would be great if Seth and Tom saved it to
use for future elections with a different dataset/CSV file. That would save a lot
of work o the front end for them. They could make a couple tweeks to commands like
loading a different file or outputting more specific results. This script could
also be used on larger electios or for different types of electios.
